<details>
<summary>for developers</summary>

- Install the package

Tun the following command to install the package **with** dev-dependencies.

`poetry install`

You should run the above command with `--without dev` if you would like to verify if your package works without dev-dependencies.

- Build the package

Run the following command to build the package.

`poetry build`

This makes `whl` and `tar.gz` without dev-dependencies at a `dist` directory, which will be generated once you run the command. The filenames generated by the command depend on the settings written in the `pyproject.toml`.

# HOW TO RUN TESTS

`poetry run pytest`.

The following command would be preferred if you need the coverage-report.

`poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing`

for seeing the report on your console, or

`poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html`

for outputting html files.
