# INTRODUCTION
This is an exmple project for packaging my own python project. This assumes you to use `poetry`.

# INSTALLATION

<details>
<summary>for users</summary>
Run the following command to install the package.

`poetry install --without dev`

</details>

<details>
<summary>for developers</summary>

- Install the package

Tun the following command to install the package **with** dev-dependencies.

`poetry install`

You should run the above command with `--without dev` if you would like to verify if your package works without dev-dependencies.

- Build the package

Run the following command to build the package.

`poetry build`

This makes `whl` and `tar.gz` without dev-dependencies at a `dist` directory, which will be generated once you run the command. The filenames generated by the command depend on the settings written in the `pyproject.toml`.

# TEST
## STATIC
Run the following commands.

- `poetry run mypy ./(py script)`

## DYNAMIC
Run either the following three commands.

- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing`
- `poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html`

The first one will do test, the second one will show the coverage-report in your terminal and the last one will generate it as html.

# DOCUMENTATION
Follow the below procedure to generate the document.

1. Create `docs` directory: `poetry run sphinx-quickstart docs`
2. Update `docs/conf.py`
   - Uncomment the following codes in the script. Also, you should modify the last line according to your directory tree.
    ```python
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../'))
    ```
   - Update the extensions.
    ```python 
        extensions = [
        'sphinx.ext.autodoc'
    ]
    ```
   - Add a theme.
    ```python
    html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
    ```
3. Update `index/rst`.
```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   example_package (whatever you would like to add to the main page)
```
4. Generate `rst` files: `poetry run sphinx-apidoc -f -o ./docs/source ../`
5. Gererate the document in `docs`: `make html`
